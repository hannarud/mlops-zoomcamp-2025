# MLOps Zoomcamp 2025 cohort

In this repository I document [my](https://github.com/hannarud) journey on MLOps Zoomcamp, cohort of 2025.

The main doc with notes is [this "Event Log"](events_log.md). Almost all other files are referenced there, so there's actually no need to describe them additionally.

Thank you [Alexey Grigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev) and [DataTalks Club team](https://github.com/DataTalksClub) for running the course! This is very valuable MLOps content which I already use in my everyday tasks.
