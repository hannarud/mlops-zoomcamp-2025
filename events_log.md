* Transfer from .ipynb to ML pipeline https://youtu.be/teP9KWkP6SM?si=wje6pBWt4VbXHY5q - watch again and apply to my work project
* MLOps maturity model: https://youtu.be/XwTH8BDGzYk?si=MPEURypKC8NjgWhV - check again what I want to cover in my current project
* MLFlow model registry automated work with hyperparameter tuning + choosing the best model based on its loss https://youtu.be/1ykg4YmbFVA?si=L-NijkWZDMwDo00h
* Try to use Kubeflow pipelines for workflow orchestration
* Using S3 bucket to receive data updates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVmaaqs63O8&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hIUISrluw_A7wDSmfOhErJK - try to establish data pipelines with periodic dataset updates and create markdown artifacts
