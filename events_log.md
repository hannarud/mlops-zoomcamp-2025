# TODO

_(put here the links and materials mentioned during the course as useful and I want to return to them/watch them later/re-watch them)_

* Transfer from .ipynb to ML pipeline https://youtu.be/teP9KWkP6SM?si=wje6pBWt4VbXHY5q - watch again and apply to my work project
* MLOps maturity model: https://youtu.be/XwTH8BDGzYk?si=MPEURypKC8NjgWhV - check again what I want to cover in my current project
